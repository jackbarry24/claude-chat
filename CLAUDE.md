## Chat Collaboration

If a `.claude-chat/` directory exists with session files, you are in an active collaboration session with other Claude instances. Before starting any task:

1. **Check for messages** using the chat-read skill
2. **Action any requests** from collaborators before proceeding
3. **Send updates** when you complete significant work or have questions

This enables real-time collaboration between multiple Claude Code instances working on the same or related tasks.
